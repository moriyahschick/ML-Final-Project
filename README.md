# NYC Crime Prediction Final Project

Denis Gostev, Mary Krakowski, Moriyah Schick

The goal of our project is to predict a crime type in NYC based on location and time. We plan to use clustering algorithm to identify and uncover geographical and temporal patterns and to discover concentration of crimes in hotspot areas. We plan to use a variety of different algorithms such as decision trees, SVM, logistic regression, an ANN, and KNN to predict the crime type in a given location within specific time interval. We will explore the issues of explainability, bias, and dimensionality reduction as it relates to our dataset. We may bring addition data to our research (such as census population information) and engineer new features based on the available data. We plan to evaluate competing models and fine tune the best performing algorithm to improve the accuracy.
