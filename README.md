# NYC Crime Prediction Final Project

Denis Gostev, Mary Krakowski, Moriyah Schick

The goal of this project is to predict crime types and crime rates in NYC using a variety of supervised learning algorithms. We were able to predict 3 chosen crimes types (burglary, intoxicated driving, and dangerous drugs) with 77% accuracy. We achieved 91% accuracy for weekly crime predictions and 95% accuracy for the daily average rates for a selected crime type (larceny). We also identified and mapped the most dangerous regions (hotspots) where the most crimes took place.
